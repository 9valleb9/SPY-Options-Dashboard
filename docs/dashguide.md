## **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **"No data found" Errors**
```
Symptoms: All tickers show "No data available"
Solutions:
1. Check internet connection: ping finance.yahoo.com
2. Try different time periods (5d instead of 30d)
3. Use daily intervals instead of intraday (1d instead of 5m)
4. Enable mock data mode for testing
5. Check if markets are currently open
```

#### **Empty Charts/No Signals**
```
Symptoms: Dashboard loads but charts are blank
Solutions:  
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try mock data mode to isolate the issue
5. Check if data_cache has valid data in logs
```

#### **Performance Issues**
```
Symptoms: Slow loading, timeouts, browser freezing
Solutions:
1. Reduce data period (use 5d instead of 30d)
2. Use larger intervals (15m instead of 5m) 
3. Disable auto-refresh temporarily
4. Close other browser tabs
5. Restart the Flask application
```

#### **Signal Accuracy Problems**
```
Symptoms: Signals don't match expected market behavior
Solutions:
1. Check if using mock data vs live data (badge indicator)
2. Verify time zone settings match market hours
3. Compare with external charting tools
4. Review signal logic in analysis framework
5. Check for data quality issues (gaps, bad ticks)
```

```
Pre-Market (8:00-9:30 AM):
1. Start dashboard with "Intraday Focus" pattern
2. Load previous day's data to assess overnight moves
3. Check VIX levels and key support/resistance
4. Prepare watchlist of potential setups

Market Hours (9:30 AM-4:00 PM):
1. Enable auto-refresh for real-time updates
2. Monitor HIGH priority alerts closely
3. Use 5-minute refresh cycle for active trading
4. Document trades with signal references

Post-Market (4:00 PM+):
1. Export Excel report for daily review
2. Analyze signal performance vs actual trades
3. Update strategy rules based on results  
4. Prepare for next trading session
```

```python
# Example: Add custom signal in spy_0dte_options_analysis.py
def calculate_custom_momentum_signal(spy_data):
    """Custom momentum signal based on price/volume"""
    price_change = spy_data['Close'].pct_change()
    volume_ratio = spy_data['Volume'] / spy_data['Volume'].rolling(20).mean()
    
    # Signal when price up >0.2% with volume >1.5x average
    custom_signal = ((price_change > 0.002) & (volume_ratio > 1.5)).astype(int)
    return custom_signal

# Add to calculate_scalping_signals method:
signals['custom_momentum'] = calculate_custom_momentum_signal(spy_data)
```

### **Custom Alert Conditions**
```python
# Add to generate_trading_alerts function:
if current_signals.get('custom_momentum', 0) == 1:
    alerts.append({
        'priority': 'HIGH',
        'type': 'CUSTOM_MOMENTUM',
        'message': 'STRONG PRICE/VOLUME MOMENTUM DETECTED',
        'action': 'Consider momentum continuation trades',
        'timeframe': '10-30 minutes',

    if signal_strength > 80:
        quantity = 10  # Full position
    elif signal_strength > 60:
        quantity = 7   # Reduced position
    else:
        return  # No trade
    
    if signal_type == 'scalp_long':
        # Place call spread order
        pass
    elif signal_type == 'scalp_short':
        # Place put spread order  
        pass
```

#### **TradingView Integration**
```javascript
// Send signals to TradingView via webhook
function sendToTradingView(signal_data) {
    const webhook_url = 'https://webhook.tradingview.com/your-webhook';
    fetch(webhook_url, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        body: JSON.stringify({
            symbol: 'SPY',
            action: signal_data.action,
            signal_strength: signal_data.strength,
